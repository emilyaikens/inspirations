## Hurdles and Wins
* Using GitHub as a team was a challenge but learning great teamwork practices for pushing and pulling code together was a huge win!
* Figuring out how to create and access data with many-to-many relationships was tricky but in learning how to do this, we gained a more thorough understanding of how to access models as well as the benefits and limitations of class-based-views.  
* Setting up a working Repository was a struggle for a while, considering we forgot a key factor; the git.ignore file. Once we added one, things became a lot smoother!

## Future features

* Ensure that users can only add inspirations to their own galleries, and not other users galleries.
* The ability to delete or edit a note.
* The first image added to the Gallery should be displayed as the thumbnail for that Gallery (the random squash photo is a place holder until this function is implemented)
