## Wins
- Learning great teamwork practices for pushing and pulling code together
- Adding Responsive CSS
- User Authentication
- Being able to add an inspiration to a Gallery and display it!

## Hurdles
- Being able to add an inspiration to a Gallery and display it.
- Gallery drop-down menu when creating an inspiration. We could not see all available Galleries in the list
- Setting up a working Repository was a struggle for a while, considering we forgot a key factor; the git.ignore file. Once we added one, things became a lot smoother.

## Future features

- [ ] The ability to delete or edit a note.
- [ ] The first image added to the Gallery should be displayed as the thumbnail for that Gallery.
